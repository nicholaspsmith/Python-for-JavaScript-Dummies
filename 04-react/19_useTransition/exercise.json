Add a search input that filters the list\n3. Use useTransition to mark the filtering as a non-urgent update\n4. Show a visual indicator while the transition is pending\n5. The input should remain responsive even during heavy filtering\n\nuseTransition lets you mark state updates as non-urgent transitions. The UI stays responsive because React can interrupt the transition to handle urgent updates (like typing).",
