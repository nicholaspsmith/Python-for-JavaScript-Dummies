Debounce the search - only 'search' after 500ms of no typing\n3. Display 'Searching...' while the debounce timer is active\n4. Show the search results (mocked) after debounce\n5. Clear results when input is empty\n\nDebouncing prevents a function from being called too frequently - essential for search inputs.",
