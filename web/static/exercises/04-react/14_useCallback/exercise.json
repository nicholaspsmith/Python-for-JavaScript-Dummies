Create a child component that receives a callback prop\n3. Wrap the child in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders\n4. Use useCallback to memoize the callback function\n5. Show render counts for both parent and child\n\nuseCallback returns a memoized version of the callback that only changes if dependencies change. Combined with React.memo, it prevents child components from re-rendering unnecessarily.",
