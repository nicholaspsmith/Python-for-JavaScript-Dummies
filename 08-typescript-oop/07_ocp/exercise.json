Create these discount strategies:\n   - NoDiscount: returns original price, description 'No discount'\n   - PercentageDiscount: takes percentage in constructor, calculates discount\n   - FixedDiscount: takes fixed amount in constructor, subtracts from price (min 0)\n   - BuyOneGetOneFree: returns price / 2, description 'Buy one get one free'\n\n3. Create a PriceCalculator class:\n   - calculateFinalPrice(price: number, discount: DiscountStrategy): number\n   - Applies the discount strategy to the price\n\n4. EXTENSION: Add a new SeasonalDiscount without modifying existing classes:\n   - Takes percentage and season name\n   - Description includes season name\n\nKey insight: Adding new discount types doesn't require changing PriceCalculator or existing strategies."
